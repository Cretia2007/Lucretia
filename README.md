# Lucretia
Hello world! I am a programming student at the University of Phoenix and I'm looking to get a jump start in my development career. My current curriculum  includes Python, Java, C++ and Javascript. As I learn to code I will be posting projects that pertain to my current job in the health care field. Feel free to reach out to me, learn and collaborate with me !
