<p>Centuries ago, five African tribes war over a 
meteorite containing vibranium. One warrior ingests a "heart-shaped herb" 
affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first "Black Panther". 
He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. The Wakandans use the vibranium
to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country. 
   </p>        
   <p>In 1992, King T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working
   undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of 
   assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium 
   from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, 
   and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.</p>        <p>In the present day, following T'Chaka's death,
   his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye, 
   the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract Nakia, T'Challa's ex-lover, from an undercover 
   assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri. At the ceremony, 
   the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades
   him to yield rather than die.</p>
